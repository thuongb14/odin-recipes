        <h2>5 Steps to Make Baked Ricotta Cake</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the pastry: </strong>place butter and 3/4 cup (165g) sugar in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Beat in 1 egg until well combined. Fold in flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt. Cut one-third of the dough, flatten into a rectangle and enclose in plastic wrap. Shape the larger piece into a rectangle and enclose in plastic wrap. Chill both blocks of pastry for 2 hours. </li>
            <li><strong>Bake the pastry: </strong>Preheat oven to 200°C. Grease a 20cm x 30cm x 5cm rectangular lamington pan and line with baking paper, leaving a 3cm overhang. Roll larger piece of pastry out between 2 sheets of lightly floured baking paper to 5mm thick. Use pastry to line the base of prepared pan, trimming the edges to fit snugly, then prick all over with a fork. Place pan on a baking tray and bake for 20-25 minutes until base is golden. Remove from oven and cool completely. </li>
            <li><strong>Make the ricotta filling: </strong>Reduce oven to 160°C. To make filling, lightly beat remaining 4 eggs. Place ricotta and cream cheese in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment and beat until smooth. Beat in vanilla, remaining 1 cup (220g) sugar and eggs to combine. </li>
            <li><strong>Chill the cake: </strong>Line sides of the pan with 6cm strips of pastry, gently pressing them onto top of cooked base to create a join (the pastry is soft, but will come together when cooked). Use a small sharp knife to trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the pan. Spoon filling into the pastry shell. Place pan on a baking tray and bake for 1 hour 20 minutes or until edges are set with a very slight wobble in the centre (it may crack a little, but will settle when it cools). Turn off the oven and set the door ajar with a wooden spoon. Leave the cake to cool completely in the oven, then chill for 6 hours to set. Use the baking paper overhang to carefully lift cake out of the pan. Dust cake with icing sugar to serve. </li>
